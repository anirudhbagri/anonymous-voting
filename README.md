# Anonymous Voting

The Idea of this app is to create a local (over-LAN) anonymous voting system.

Currently the system allows only voting for either Yes or No.


# Setup

1. Run the server.py file using python from any computer in network which is accessible from other devices in network.
2. Install the client app on any android/ios device.
3. Once installed, find the IP address of the device on which the server is running and enter that in client app.
4. Everything should work as expcted if *ping* command is running successfully.
